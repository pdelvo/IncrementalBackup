IncrementalBackup
=================

A experimental command line backup software

This is currently mostly a test. Developed was this software to backup minecraft worlds on a multi player server. Because backups can become very large and most of the time just a little part has been changed since the last backup.

#Avialable commands:

* help
* create
* extract
* combine
* info
