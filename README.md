Incremental Backup
=================

A experimental command line backup software

This is currently mostly a test. Developed was this software to backup minecraft worlds on a multi player server. Because backups can become very large and most of the time just a little part has been changed since the last backup.

##Available commands:

* help
* create
* extract
* combine
* info

##Planned commands

* pack - Packs multiple backups into one zip file that can be used directly (extract into an archive)
* log - displays a list of a backup path with messages and dates
* revisions - show in which backups a file got changed
 and some more less important ones
